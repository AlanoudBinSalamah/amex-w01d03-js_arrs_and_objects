var  aquarium = {
    filledWithWater: true,
    capacityInGallons: 12,
    numberOfRocks: 5,
    fish: [
            {
                type: 'goldfish' ,
                size: '3.5 inches',
                color: 'golden'
            },
            {
                type: 'puffer',
                size: '4 inches',
                color: 'tan'
            },
            {
                type: 'clown',
                size: '3 inches',
                color: 'orange'
